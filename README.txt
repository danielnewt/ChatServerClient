******** Important information ********

The following classes have main methods:
-	ChatServer - Starts the server
-	ChatClient - Starts the console client
-	ChatClientGUI - starts the GUI client

The following text commands can be used in the console client:
-	GETNAMES - Returns a list of all the online clients
-	QUIT - Shuts down the client application
-	CHANGENAME - Allows client to change their clientName 

The ComboBox in the GUI version of the client affects how messages are sent:
-	ALL - Broadcasts the message to all clients
-	SET NAME - Attempts to change the clients name to the text entered
-	[Client Names] - The names of all other clients will appear in the list, select one to private message that person

When the client fails to connect to the server:
- The console client will just shut itself down.
- The GUI client will display an alert window to reconnect or close the application.
